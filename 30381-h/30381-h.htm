<div class="bk3"><h1>Prelude To Space</h1>

<h2><i>By Robert W. Haseltine</i></h2></div></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;was</span> climbing the steep side
of a central Wisconsin hill,
holding my bow away from my
body for balance, when I first saw
the stranger. He sat on a stump
at the crest and watched me struggle
up. As I drew nearer I panted
out a greeting and received his
cheerful "Hi" in return. When I
finally reached the top, I threw
myself on the ground and began
catching my breath.</p>

<p>He didn't say anything at first,
just looked at the bow and the
quiver of arrows on my back. Finally
he said, "May I look at it?"
and reached for the bow. I handed
it to him. He examined it
carefully and returned it.</p>

<p>"Beautiful workmanship. Is that
all you use?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I never cared much for guns,"
I answered. "I've always thought
a bow gave the animal more of an
even chance for his life."</p>

<p>We talked then on the various
aspects of hunting and how the
crisp fall air seemed to make the
deer seem closer than during the
heat of summer. While we talked
I tried to place the reason he disturbed
me, but I couldn't seem to
do it. He was dressed in an old
plaid shirt and dungarees and his
blond hair wasn't many shades removed
from my own straw thatch.
But there was something odd about
him that I couldn't quite find.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's the cloth." His
words surprised me. "You see,
it hasn't been discovered on
this planet as yet." My face
must have shown astonishment because
he went on in the same vein.
"I admit it's confusing, but it's
also true. My clothes weren't
made on Earth." He chuckled then,
deep in his throat. "I don't blame
you for being confused. I know
how I would feel if I met an extraterrestrial
being before space
travel was a reality."</p>

<p>I kept staring at him. Finally
I blurted out, "What in Sam Hill
are you talking about?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward on the stump
and his face grew earnest. "You
might say I'm a poll taker. I have
to decide certain things from various
interviews with individuals I
meet."</p>

<p>"What are you trying to prove?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but I can't tell you
that until I'm finished with the
interview. If I told you, your interest
in the subject would tend
to prejudice your answers."</p>

<p>"Fair enough. What do you
want to ask me?"</p>

<p>He pulled out a notebook and
smiled. "These questions may
seem a little silly but I must have
straight answers to them. Will
you go along with me?"</p>

<p>I nodded my head.</p>

<p>"Let's see now. If you were the
head of a government and wanted
to ascertain whether another country
was ready for admission into
the United Nations, what would
you do?"</p>

<p>I shrugged. "I suppose I would
read books and magazines from the
country and possibly have an interview
with the heads of the government.
After I had collected my
data I could then act upon it."</p>

<p>"For the sake of argument suppose
the books and other periodicals
were written so as to be prejudicial
in favor of the government,
and the heads also were coloring
what they said."</p>

<p>I thought for a minute. "In that
case I suppose I would secretly
place someone inside the country
to interview the people and get a
first hand view of the situation.
Then I would act on his data."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> nodded his head. "Yes, the
people themselves and the
conditions they live in will give
you the needed data." He turned
a page in the book. "Now suppose
that you wished to know if a certain
planet was ready to enter into
an organization such as the Galactic
Federation, what would you
do?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I'd act as I did before.
Place people inside the various
areas of the planet to interview
and observe. They would
bring back the information needed
to ascertain whether they would be
an asset or a detriment to the organization."</p>

<p>I thought to myself that the
question was a trifle silly; after all,
hadn't science proved that life
couldn't exist on the other planets
in our system?</p>

<p>He relaxed after I answered and
his smile was brighter than the
previous ones. "Right," he said.
"Naturally we had to learn the
language first, but now a first-hand
check can be made. You see,
there is a civilization out there,"
he raised his hand and swept the
sky, "and we have to check to see
if this planet is ready to take its
place as an adult civilization with
the rest of us.</p>

<p>"Earth, within a very short time,
will be reaching her fingers into
space. Once she gets there she will
be eligible to join the Galactic Federation."</p>

<p>"That's all right," I said, "then
we can exchange culture and
knowledge with other civilizations."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you are eligible to join."</p>

<p>"But you said that once we reach
space we will be eligible."</p>

<p>"Look at it this way," he said.
"The main purpose of the Galactic
Federation is to promote peace
and understanding among the various
planets. Earth would have to
be prepared to take its place as
just another member, and not an
important member at that. Earth,
you see, is one of the smaller planets
and also would be the latest
one to join.</p>

<p>"In times past some planets have
reached space without being fully
prepared for what they would find.
They still had internal troubles on
their own worlds. We had to place
them in quarantine until they
reached that degree of civilization
where they were ready to live in
peace. Now we check a planet
before it reaches the space-travel
stage. We find out the reactions
of the inhabitants to certain situations."</p>

<p>"What sort of situations?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, naturally we want to see
their artifacts as an indication as
to their advancement. We have to
know what the average man thinks
of space travel and trade with other
planets. And their ideas on peace
and their feelings towards their
fellow men. All are very important.</p>

<p>"Actually, when a planet once
enters the Federation the people
are the ones to decide on peace and
war. So if the majority of the
people on a planet are peace-loving
that planet is ready to enter the
Federation."</p>

<p>"But how do you find out all
these things?" I asked. "When a
man finds out what you are trying
to prove he may lie because he
wants to get into space."</p>

<p>His eyes held a mischievous glint
as he answered. "Simple, the art
of telepathy has been highly developed
among my race. I have
your thoughts on everything I've
mentioned. Later, when all the
data from thousands of similar interviews
is in it will be evaluated
and the decision made as to whether
your world will be allowed to
reach space. We have the means
of keeping you from it if we decide
you aren't yet ready."</p>

<p>He stood up and I followed suit.
"I must be going now," he sighed.
"This work keeps me on the run
and I have many more interviews
to make. Believe me, it was a
pleasure meeting you. I hope we
meet again&mdash;later." We shook
hands and he strolled over the hill
into the valley.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should have followed
him, but it wouldn't have done any
good, really. Because a few moments
later I saw something shimmering
over the top of the hill. It
was big and disc-shaped and shot
into the sky with a speed that was
unbelievable.</p>

<p>I still don't know what to think
about him or what we talked about.
I'm going to keep watching the papers
though, and hoping he got
the right answers. If we reach
the Moon I'll know he did....</p>
